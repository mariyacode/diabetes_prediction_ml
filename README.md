# diabetes_prediction_ml
Machine learning project to predict diabetes using logistics regression.
This is a simple and basic AI/ML project to predict whether a person has diabetes or not based on health related data like glucose level,blood pressure,age,BMI,and more.
Dataset used:PIMA Indians Diabetes dataset (sourced from kaggle)
Technologies used-Python,google colab,Scikit-learn(Logistic Regression),pandas,numpy,Matplotlib,Seaborn
Model accuracy:74.67% accuracy
what the model does:The machine learning model learns from past data and predicts if a new person is likely to be diabetic or not based on their health inputs.
